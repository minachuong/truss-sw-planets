# Truss StarWars Planets

Candidate Submission By Mina Chuong

This is my technical sample for the problem indicated [here](https://github.com/trussworks/truss-interview/blob/main/BROWSER_README.md).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.1.

This project requires an active LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm package manager (which is installed with Node by default).

After cloning [this repository](https://github.com/minachuong/truss-sw-planets) locally, run `npm install` to acquire all dependencies needed for this project.

The following are instructions if you do NOT have Angular CLI installed locally. 
If you have Angular CLI and would like to use it, skip to [here](#Instructions-with-Angular-CLI).

## Instructions without Angular CLI
### Development server
