# Truss StarWars Planets

Candidate Submission By Mina Chuong

This is my technical sample for the problem indicated [here](https://github.com/trussworks/truss-interview/blob/main/BROWSER_README.md).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.1 and we'll be using Angular CLI to serve and build the app. Angular CLI requires a minimum [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version of either v12.14 or v14.15.

After cloning [this repository](https://github.com/minachuong/truss-sw-planets) locally, run `npm install` to acquire all dependencies needed for this project.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests
Please note, due to limited time, tests are incomplete.
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
